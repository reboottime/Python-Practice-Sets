# SOLID Principle

- Single Responsibility: to class and method. Do one thing and do it well
- Liskov: Liskov is about the behavior of things that share the same interface, not defining the interface itself.
  - Interface: About object shape contract. Interface = "Do you have the right parts?"
  - Liskov: about object's behavior contract. Liskov = "Do those parts actually work as expected?"
